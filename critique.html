                The main goal of the <a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/08/filmordigital/"><strong>pudding article</strong></a> is to settle the long running debate between cinema lovers : whether the movie should be shot on film or digitally. The data comprises Top 100 movies for each year starting from 2006 to 2017. Various fields like budget, director name, camera lens, negative format were collected from sources IMDb and The Numbers. The camera lens and negative format attributes were used to derive the medium of the movie. The article serves the purpose of laying out all the factors that are decisive in choosing the movie medium.

                The pudding article starts with a big Gotham title on a dark background. At first sight, it doesn’t look more like a cinema theme. Using something like Marvin Visions or Impact for the heading would have given more of a movie vibe. It seems to be too minimal for any movie related theme. Opting for something like movie bulb lights or maybe even some movie posters would have made a great cover.

                After the quick intro, it shows a chart depicting the meteoric rise of movies shot digitally between the period of 2006 - 2017. The stacked bar chart is clearly helpful in visualising the contribution of both the mediums over the years. It’s hard to understand the fact that only the top 100 movies were selected for the chart. While the chart is successful in showing the trend, maybe having more movies might depict a more accurate picture.

                The author then moves on to another visualisation which shows various director’s preferred mediums over the years. It shows how some filmmakers have remained loyal to the medium they started with, while some of the filmmakers were early adopters of the digital medium. It also depicts the third kind, where few filmmakers used the medium according to their taste, according to what they wanted to show in the movie. The author divided the chart in years and also shows the path that shows which medium the director preferred over the years. The circle packing visualisation gives a thorough understanding of how many movies were made on which medium over the years. The medium of interaction for the chart is very novel and much intuitive. It’s helpful in showing the medium trend based on the director's choice. On the aesthetics part, maybe having a cinema reel as a background for each of those clusters would have provided a nice setting.

                Author then shows the medium selection based on movie genres over the years. While some of the filmmakers argue that they prefer the medium based on the genre they’re shooting for, in most of the cases, the directors have embraced the digital medium to a great extent.

                The author then shows the relationship between medium and movie budget. Given the fact that digital medium is less expensive than film medium, most of the low cost movies have adopted to be shot on digital medium. Another surprising fact was that 6% of both low budget and high budget movies were still using film as the preferred medium. While most of the filmmakers for a high budget movie, have opted to smartly use both the mediums depending on the scene. While the table is simple, it is hard to compare the budget allocations across the medium. A chart comparing all 3 medium categories in one table divided by the time period would have made more sense and easier in correlating.

                The author then shows the circle packing visualisation of movies distributed based on budget categories and years vis-a-vis also showing the medium of movie. 

                The author ends the story on the note that it‘s not a war between two mediums and rather it’s based on personal choice of aesthetics that the director wants to implement. Overall it nicely explains the breakdown and the factors affecting the shooting medium for Hollywood movies. While the author is of the opinion that the shooting medium depends upon the aesthetics that movie demands and/or the director’s personal choice, it fails to explain why some movies like Hacksaw RIdge, The Founder, Mad Max : Fury Road, Man From UNCLE, etc preferred the digital medium and movies like Jack Reacher, Suicide Squad, etc preferred the film medium.
